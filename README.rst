In this repository, you'll find all the information about integrating Auth0 with Python.

Check out the examples that we have in here in our examples folder. Each of them has a README on how to run them and on how to use them.


==============
What is Auth0?
==============

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with `multiple authentication sources <https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders>`_,
  either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**,
  or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **`linking different user accounts <https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts>`_** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed `Json Web Tokens <https://docs.auth0.com/jwt>`_ to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through `JavaScript rules <https://docs.auth0.com/rules>`_.
