Pytest plugin that manages the WireMock container lifecycle for wire tests.

This plugin is loaded globally for the test suite and is responsible for
starting and stopping the WireMock container exactly once per test run,
including when running with pytest-xdist over the entire project.

It lives under tests/ (as tests/conftest.py) and is discovered automatically
by pytest's normal test collection rules.
